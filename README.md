# ⬡ PharmaShield AI

**Real-time Drug Interaction Detection & Risk Analysis**

> Built with Python · Flask · scikit-learn · Groq AI (Llama 3.3) · Vanilla JS

---

## What It Does

PharmaShield AI detects harmful drug interactions in real time. Enter any combination of medicines with dosage, gender, and medical conditions — the ML model scores the risk instantly, and Groq AI generates a plain-language explanation of what's happening and why.

**Key Features:**
- 🤖 **GradientBoosting ML model** — classifies risk as Low / Moderate / High / Critical
- 🧬 **Groq Llama 3.3** — generates personalised clinical explanations
- 💊 **Drug pair analysis** — checks every combination of entered medicines
- 👤 **Patient-aware** — adjusts for gender, medical conditions, and dosage
- 📊 **Per-pair confidence breakdown** — shows probability for each risk level
- 🌙 Dark/Light theme, autocomplete, WhatsApp share, local history

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- VS Code with the **Live Server** extension
- A free Groq API key from [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com)

---

## Setup & Run

### 1. Get a Groq API Key
Sign up at [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com) (no billing required), then go to **API Keys → Create API Key** and copy it.

### 2. Create the `.env` file
Inside the `backend/` folder, create a file named exactly `.env`:

```
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_your_actual_key_here
```

> ⚠️ No quotes around the key. No spaces around `=`. Windows users: make sure File Explorer shows extensions so it's not saved as `.env.txt`.

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Train the ML model *(run once)*

```bash
python ml/train_model.py
```

Expected output:
```
✅ Training samples: 1640+
✅ Model saved → ml/model.pkl
✅ Metadata saved → ml/meta.json
```

### 5. Start the Flask backend

```bash
python app.py
```

Expected output:
```
✅ Groq AI (Llama 3) loaded successfully.
✅ interactions.json loaded — 82 entries.
✅ ML model loaded and ready.
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

> ✅ All three lines must appear before opening the frontend.

### 6. Open the frontend
In VS Code, right-click `frontend/index.html` → **Open with Live Server**.  
Browser opens at `http://127.0.0.1:5500`.

## API Reference

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/` | Serves index.html |
| POST | `/api/check` | ML scoring + Groq AI explanation |
| POST | `/api/check-interactions` | Alias for `/api/check` |
| GET | `/api/medicines` | Returns all drug names for autocomplete |
| GET | `/api/model-status` | Returns `{ ml_ready: true/false }` |

### POST `/api/check` — Request Body

```json

  "medicines": [
    { "name": "warfarin", "dosage": "5mg" },
    { "name": "aspirin", "dosage": "100mg" }
  ],
  "gender": "female",
  "conditions": ["Diabetes", "Hypertension"],
  "patient": { "age": 65, "weight": 70 }
}
```

### POST `/api/check` — Response

```json

  "interactions": [
    {
      "drug1": "warfarin", "drug2": "aspirin",
      "severity": "dangerous",

  }
}
```

## Test Combinations

| Medicines | Expected Risk | Reason |
|-----------|--------------|--------|
| warfarin + aspirin | ⚠️ Critical | Additive bleeding — COX + anticoagulant |
| fluoxetine + tramadol | ⚠️ Critical | Serotonin syndrome risk |
| simvastatin + clarithromycin | ⚠️ Critical | CYP3A4 → rhabdomyolysis |
| sildenafil + nitrates | ⚠️ Critical | Fatal hypotension |
| atenolol + verapamil | ⚠️ Critical | Complete heart block risk |
| aspirin + ibuprofen | ⚡ Moderate | Competing COX-1 binding |
| metformin + furosemide | ⚡ Moderate | Lactic acidosis risk |
| paracetamol + ibuprofen | ✅ Low | Generally safe |
| cetirizine + loratadine | ✅ Low | No significant interaction |

## How the ML Model Works

The GradientBoosting classifier is trained on 82 curated drug pairs from `interactions.json`. Each pair is encoded into a feature vector:

- Drug name hashes (consistent numeric encoding)
- Drug pair hash (order-independent fingerprint)
- Gender encoding (male=1 / female=0)
- 10-dimensional condition vector (diabetes, hypertension, kidney disease, etc.)
- Dosage quantities and derived features (ratio, combined total)

The model outputs a risk class (0=Low, 1=Moderate, 2=High, 3=Critical) with confidence probabilities. If combined dosage exceeds 6 units, the risk is bumped up one level. If the database knows a pair is more severe than ML predicted, the database value wins.

## Groq AI Integration

- **Model:** `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`
- **Free tier:** 14,400 requests/day — plenty for any demo
- Groq receives the ML result and patient profile, then generates a plain-language clinical explanation
- If Groq fails, the app automatically falls back to rich text from `interactions.json` — the user always gets a response

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| `GROQ_API_KEY not found: False` | Check `.env` is in `backend/`, named exactly `.env`, no quotes around key |
| `Groq not configured — using fallback` | Same as above |
| `ML model not found` | Run `python ml/train_model.py` from `backend/` |
| `Could not connect to backend` | Make sure `app.py` is running on port 5000 first |
| `model_decommissioned` error | Change model name in `call_groq()` to `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` |
| CORS error in browser | Confirm `Flask-Cors` is installed and `CORS(app)` is in `app.py` |
| `interactions.json not found` | File must be in `backend/` (same level as `app.py`) |
